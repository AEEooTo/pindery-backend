# Pindery Backend
Backend for [Pindery](https://github.com/AEEooTo/pindery) app, built with Firebase's authentication, database and serverless functions infrastructure. The used language is Typescript with Node.js.
For the moment we are using just one function to send a notification in case of a new party.
